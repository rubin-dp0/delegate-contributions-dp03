# Asteroid Taxonomy
This repository is for DP0 delegates to contribute and share DP0.3-related materials (e.g., code, analysis tools, tutorials) to perform asteroid 
taxonomies based on LSST data.   We present a jupyter notebook that allowed to perform the spectral classification of asteroids using the DeMeo
and Carry (2013) approach based on LSST photometric data.


## How to contribute to this repository.

Please contribute only code that you have verified to run.  Tutorials could be Jupyter Notebooks or markdown-formatted demonstrations of a DP0-related analysis with command-line tasks or the Portal Aspect.  Please contact Valerio Carruba (valerio.carruba@unesp.br) for additions to this
repository. Direct messages between delegates in Community.lsst.org are an appropriate mode of contact.

### Best Practices

Please always:
- document your code for non-experts
- provide links to background information
- clear notebook outputs before committing changes

All tutorials should have a header containing:
 - the author's name
 - the date the tutorial was last tested
 - the goals of the notebook

Do not use the Rubin logo in the header unless you are Rubin staff preparing a tutorial under the guidelines of RTN-045.
Consider rebranding your notebook with your own institute's logo or a personal logo or picture.

See the example directory for guidance on formatting notebooks and markdown files.
